## Topic 2: Preserve Today for Tomorrow: Why Archives Matter

## Inspiration
	- Our inspiration comes from when documents are being digitalized they’re oftentime not accessible by prioritizing a people first design, screen readers can’t read image only PDFs, search doesn’t work, and sharing is really messy. We wanted an archive tool that treats accessibility as the default—OCR for readability, text-to-speech, translation, and export formats so more people can actually use preserved information.
